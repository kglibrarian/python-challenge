# python-challenge
The python-challenge repository has two directories: PyBank and PyPoll. Both directories contain python code used to complete challenges that encompasses a real-world situations. 

## PyBank
The PyBank directory contains Python script for analyzing the financial records of a ficticious company. The Python script analyzes budget data to calculate: 

   * The total number of months included in the dataset
   * The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
   * The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
   * The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
   * The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

In addition, the final script prints the analysis to the terminal and exports a text file with the results.
   
## PyPoll

in the PyPoll challenge we were tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process. The directory contains a set of polling data with information on the "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate". The directory also contains a script that analyzes and calculates the following: 

  * The total number of votes cast
  * A complete list of candidates who received votes
  * The percentage of votes each candidate won
  * The total number of votes each candidate won
  * The winner of the election based on popular vote.

In addition, the final script should prints the analysis to the terminal and exports a text file with the results.
